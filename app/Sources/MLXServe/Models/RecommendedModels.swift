/// `gemmaModelOptions`: that catalog is a flat download-tray list keyed for
/// CLI-style browsing, where this one needs the descriptive copy the pane
/// renders. Both point at the same underlying HuggingFace repos.
///
/// Every `sizeGB` below is the real on-disk weight size — summed from each
/// repo's safetensors dtype byte counts via the HuggingFace API, the same

/// # Capability scores (`intelligence` / `speed` / `contextTokens`)
///
/// The three bars the Model Browser draws. All three describe the ORIGINAL
/// published weights, not the 4-bit/2-bit build this pick downloads — a quant
/// moves quality a little and speed a lot, and pretending otherwise would make
/// every bar a claim we can't source.
///
/// **Intelligence** is the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index
/// (<https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/open-source>), read on **2026-07-30**,
/// rescaled `round(index / 60 × 100)` so the bar is "fraction of the best model
/// available anywhere" (the index's frontier sat at 61 that day). Where a model
/// is published in both reasoning and non-reasoning modes the REASONING number
/// is used — this app runs them with thinking available. Models the site has no
/// entry for carry our own estimate and `intelligenceIsEstimated = true`; there
/// is no "unrated" state, because a missing bar reads as "bad" rather than
/// "unknown".
///
/// **Speed** is always our OWN relative estimate, never the site's: their
/// figure is measured on cloud GPUs, and that ordering does not survive the
/// move to Apple Silicon, where decode is bandwidth-bound and ACTIVE
/// parameters dominate. Same M4 Max, 26.7.12 bench (benchmarks.md; the
/// per-cell CSV lives in git history at docs/perf-csvs/all-26.7.12.csv):
/// `gemma4-26b-a4b` 118 tok/s against `gemma4-31b` 25 tok/s — a 4.7× gap a
/// cloud comparison shows as nearly level. The score is `round(100 × tok/s / 200)`
/// over PLAIN autoregressive decode, calibrated against that CSV where a row
/// exists and estimated from active params + weight bytes elsewhere.
/// Speculative decode (MTP/PLD/drafter) is deliberately excluded: it is a
/// property of how we run the model rather than of the model, it moves some
/// picks 2-3× on their own, and each pick that has one already says so in its
/// blurb. `activeParamsB` exists so these hand-edited numbers can be CHECKED
/// rather than trusted — see the ordering invariant in `RecommendedModelsTests`.
///
/// **Context** is the checkpoint's own `max_position_embeddings`, read from
